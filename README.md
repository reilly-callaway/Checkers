# Checkers
Text based checkers game made by Reilly Callaway <br><br>
Rules: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draughts <br><br>
Version 0.2 - 28/2/2015 22:29:<br>
    MultiJump move added! Once capturing a peice you will now have the option to jump and capture another peice if available.<br><br>
Version 0.1.1 - 27/2/2015 18:52:<br>
    Fixed scoring system, now has a running score for both players.<br><br>
Version 0.1 - 27/2/2015 18:42:<br>
    Minimal viable product. Can currently move in all diagonal directions, jumping to capture a piece will not result in being able to capture another peice that turn and reaching the opposite side of the board will not make you a king. The game will end once all the player's pieces have been captured but the result of the winner will not be displayed.
